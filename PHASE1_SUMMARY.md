  - `make test/migrate` - Django operations
  - `make ruff-lint/ruff-format` - Code quality tools
  
- ✅ Updated `CLAUDE.md` documentation:
  - Documented current implementation status
  - Listed deviations from target architecture
  - Added Docker-specific notes

- ✅ Created `MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md`:
  - Prioritized remaining work into 4 phases
  - Estimated timelines for each phase
  - Clear next steps for full compliance

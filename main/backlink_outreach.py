I hope this email finds you well. I recently came across your excellent resource page at {target_site['url']} and wanted to suggest a valuable addition for your visitors.

We've developed a comprehensive suite of economic damages calculators specifically designed for legal professionals. These free tools include:

• Lost Earnings Calculator with state-specific wage data
• Present Value Calculator with multiple discount rate methodologies
• Life Care Cost Estimator with medical inflation projections
• Business Valuation Quick Assessment Tool
• Household Services Valuation Calculator

These calculators are based on accepted forensic economic principles and include detailed methodology explanations that attorneys find helpful when preparing cases.

The tools are available at: {self.domain}/tools/

What makes these calculators particularly valuable:
- Free to use with no registration required
- Based on current economic data and accepted methodologies
- Include printable reports for case documentation
- Mobile-responsive for use in court or meetings

Would this be a valuable addition to your resource page? I'd be happy to provide additional information or create a custom introduction for your audience.

I've been following {target_site['name']} and appreciate your in-depth coverage of litigation support topics.

As a forensic economist with 15+ years of experience providing expert witness services, I'd like to contribute a guest post that would provide valuable insights for your readers. Here are three article ideas:

1. "The Hidden Economic Damages Attorneys Often Overlook"
   - Coverage of frequently missed damage categories
   - Real case examples (anonymized)
   - Practical checklist for attorneys
   (1,800 words with infographics)

2. "How to Calculate Lost Earnings: A Step-by-Step Guide for Attorneys"
   - Detailed methodology explanation
   - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
   - Interactive calculator demonstration
   (2,000 words with examples)

3. "5 Critical Questions to Ask Your Economic Expert Before Trial"
   - Key qualification inquiries
   - Red flags to watch for
   - Preparation strategies
   (1,500 words)

Each article would include:
- Original research and data
- Practical tools attorneys can use immediately
- Custom graphics or calculators
- No promotional content (just an author bio)

I can provide writing samples and my professional credentials for your review.

Would any of these topics interest your readers?

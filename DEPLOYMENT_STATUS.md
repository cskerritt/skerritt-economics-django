# Deployment Status - Docker CI/CD Setup

## ✅ Completed Actions

1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow** (`deploy.yml`)
   - Added Docker image building to GitHub Container Registry
   - Configured automatic deployment on push to main
   - Added build caching for faster deployments

2. **Updated docker-compose.yml**
   - Changed from local build to using GHCR image
   - Image: `ghcr.io/cskerritt/skerritt-economics-django:latest`

3. **Deployment Script Ready**
   - Script at: `/usr/local/bin/deploy_app.sh`
   - Handles pulling, restarting, and cleanup

4. **Successfully Pushed to GitHub**
   - Commit: `52168d1` - "Enhance deployment workflow with Docker and GitHub Container Registry"
   - Push completed at: `412a01d`

## 🚀 GitHub Actions Now Running

The workflow is now triggered and will:
1. Build your Django app Docker image
2. Push it to GitHub Container Registry
3. SSH to your Lightsail instance
4. Pull the new image and restart containers

## 📋 Required GitHub Secrets

**IMPORTANT**: The deployment will fail if these secrets are not set!

Go to: https://github.com/cskerritt/skerritt-economics-django/settings/secrets/actions

Add these secrets:
- **LIGHTSAIL_HOST**: `54.243.84.130`
- **LIGHTSAIL_USERNAME**: `bitnami`
- **LIGHTSAIL_KEY**: (your SSH private key content)
- **LIGHTSAIL_PORT**: `22` (optional)

## 🔍 Monitor Deployment

1. **Check GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/cskerritt/skerritt-economics-django/actions
   - Look for "Build and Deploy to AWS Lightsail" workflow
   - It should be running now

2. **If Secrets Are Missing**:
   - The build stage will succeed
   - The deploy stage will fail with authentication error
   - Add the secrets and re-run the workflow

3. **Check Deployment on Server**:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   docker compose logs -f django
   ```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If the deployment fails:

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for error messages
2. **Verify secrets** are correctly set
3. **SSH to server** and check:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs django --tail 100
   docker ps -a
   ```

## 📌 Next Steps

1. **Add GitHub Secrets immediately** (if not already done)
2. **Monitor the GitHub Actions** workflow
3. **Verify site is working** after deployment completes
4. **Test the full cycle** by making a small change and pushing

## 🎯 Success Indicators

When successful, you'll see:
- ✅ Green checkmark on GitHub Actions
- ✅ Container running: `docker ps` shows `skerritt_django`
- ✅ Site accessible at http://54.243.84.130
- ✅ Logs show no errors: `docker compose logs`

## 📝 Notes

- First deployment may take longer due to image building
- Subsequent deployments will be faster due to caching
- The system now supports zero-downtime deployments
- Every push to `main` triggers automatic deployment
